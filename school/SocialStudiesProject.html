	<h1>Script</h1>
	<div class=a><i>[Priests are standing around a small bed that the mummy will lie on. One visitor is carrying the other onto the stage]</i></div>
	<div class=ns><b>Natsha:</b> Em hotep nefer. How terrible that our governor, _________, has passed. Now, we must mummify him/her to prepare him/her for the afterlife.</div>
	<div class=md><b>Michelle:</b> After a person has passed, they are sent through to the afterlife. A life beyond death, where you are resurrected.</div>
	<div class=lb><b>Liam:</b> Mummifying a body slows down the process of decomposition. In the afterlife, you use the body you had when you were alive.</div>
	<div class=md><b>Michelle:</b> Additionally, we will bury _______’s items along with him/her, so that she/he can use them in the afterlife.</div>
	<div class=ns><b>Natsha:</b> If you want to stay and watch, you can.</div>
	<div class=v><b>Visitor:</b> Though a governor like me has places to be, I guess I can spare time to watch. I’ve never seen a mummification before... (sits down on floor)</div>
	<div class=lb><b>Liam:</b> First, we will take out the organs, except for the heart.</div>
	<div class=tn><b>Tina:</b> Osiris will use the heart to judge _______ on the way to the afterlife.</div>
	<div class=ns><b>Natsha:</b> The heart will be weighed against the feather of truth. If the heart is too heavy, then ________ will not be allowed into the afterlife.</div>
	<div class=lb><b>Liam:</b> (cuts open the body with a knife)</div>
	<div class=tn><b>Tina:</b> (takes out the organs)</div>
	<div class=md><b>Michelle:</b> (takes the brain in her hand and stares at it) What’s this weird spongy thing anyways? Seems pretty useless to me. (throws the brain over her shoulder)</div>
	<div class=ns><b>Natsha:</b> Now we put the organs in jars. We put the organs in the jars because they are needed in the afterlife.</div>
	<div class=a>(Each person put one organ into a jar)</div>
	<div class=tn><b>Tina:</b> We will now pour palm wine and natron to remove the moisture inside this body. Natron will also be poured into the jars for the same reason.</div>
	<div class=ns><b>Natsha:</b> (place natron packets into body)</div>
	<div class=lb><b>Liam:</b> (pours palm wine into body)</div>
	<div class=md><b>Michelle:</b> (pours natron onto body)</div>
	<div class=tn><b>Tina:</b> (pours natron into the jars)</div>
	<div class=a><i>[Priests and visitor walk off stage They wait a few seconds before walking back on.]</i></div>
	<div class=lb><b>Liam:</b> We have waited 35 days, enough time for the natron to dry out the body and organs.</div>
	<div class=ns><b>Natasha:</b> We will now remove the natron and anoint the body with frankincense and myrrh oils.</div>
	<div class=tn><b>Tina:</b> (removes natron packets)</div>
	<div class=lb-md><b><font color="9b3cba">Michelle</font> &#038; <!--This is an "&" sign--> <font color="38761d">Liam</font>:</b> (anoints body)</div>
	<div class=tn><b>Tina:</b> We are now going to wrap the body with linen covered in magic spells. Then we’ll place the body in a sarcophagus, which is a large stone coffin.</div>
	<div class=a>(Everyone works together to wrap body with linen and then slowly place body into the sarcophagus)</div>
	<div class=v><b>Visitor:</b> Thank you, that was incredibly interesting to watch. Well, I’d better get going. (walks offstage with coffin)</div>
