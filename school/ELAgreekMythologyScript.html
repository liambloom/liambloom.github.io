		<br><u>Script:</u>
		<br><i>[Scene begins with Persephone painting a flower on board]</i>
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> (turns and sees bush) Oh my, what an unusual bush. Hmmm, (stops and thinks for a second) I don’t like it. (walks over to bush, and starts pulling) . Come on you stubborn bush! (Bush comes free and Persephone falls backward).
		<br><b>Hades -</b> (Enters) Well, well, well, look who pulled my little bush…
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> Ahhh! Who are you!?
		<br><b>Hades -</b> Oh, me? You should know who I am. I’m Hades, lord of the underworld, and you’re coming with me little lady!
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!
		<br>(Hades drags Persephone into the Underworld)
		<br>
		<br><b>Hades -</b> [peeking out from Ms. Butters door. Looks to each side] Hey Zeus. So, I just took Persephone with me to the underworld, and Demeter will insist that I kidnapped her, but I would never do something so terrible. And if maybe you could tell her so back down… [produces thunderbolt from under cloak]
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> Oh, yes, I’m sure Demeter will come to her senses soon enough [Takes thunderbolt]
		<br><b>Hades -</b> Oh and I was never here [backs up and closes door]
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> I wonder where Persephone is, she’s usually back by now. (anxious/nervous look on face) [walk towards door, calling Persephone] (See’s paint pot and bush lying on ground) What happened?!
		<br>(Little Boy stands by the side)
		<br><b>Little Boy -</b> Ha Ha! Little weepy woman over here!
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> [Demeter looks at the boy angrily and points] <a herf="https://translate.google.com/#en/el/Become%20a%20Lizard">Gínete sávra!</a>
		<br><b>Little Boy -</b> [hides behind chromebook cart and places lizard where he was standing]
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> [throws lizard] Die!
		<br>(The bird flies to Demeter)
		<br>
		<br><b>Bird -</b> Miss Demeter! I saw someone take Persephone! He was covered in black and had a black crown on his head! He took her into that big hole in the ground.
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> Hades! That scoundrel. I will get Zeus, surely he will help me to make him give Persephone back [marches over to Zeus, angrily.] ”Justice! Justice!” Your brother Hades has stolen my daughter-our daughter.
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> Peace, good sister. Compose yourself. Hades’ wooing has been a trifle abrupt, perhaps, but after all, he is my brother-our brother, and is accounted a good match. Think, sweet Demeter. It is difficult for our daughter to look beyond the family without marrying far beneath her.
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> Never! It must not be! Anyone but Hades! Don’t you realize, it’s a flower child, a  delicate child. No ray of sunlight ever pierces that dank hole he calls his kingdom. She’ll wither and die!
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> She is our daughter, I fancy she has a talent for survival. Pray, think it over.
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> Once again, will you restore my daughter to me? 
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> My dear, when your rage cools, you will realize this is a fine match, the very best thing for the child. Please, go back to Earth and give yourself a chance to be intelligent about this.
		Demeter -</b> I will go back to Earth.. And I will not return until you send for me.
		<br>
		<br>(Zeus looks at his thunderbolt strangely)
		<br><b>Demeter: *Gasps*</b> That scoundrel Hades gave you that thunderbolt!
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> I would never accept bribery. Now please, come back when you’ve calmed down.
		<br>(Demeter Exits Angirly)
		<br>
		<br>(Weeks pass by, nothing is growing)
		<br>(Liam, Kendyl, and Maritza beg Zeus to save the crops) (Very dramatic)
		<br>(Waits a few seconds and walk towards the door)
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> What’s going on down there?
		<br>
		<br>(Demeter walks in)
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> Until I get my daughter back, no crops will grow all around the Earth. The sooner you get her back, the less suffering man will have to endure. 
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> Very well. Your daughter shall be restored to you and shall remain with you. However, if any food has passed her lips during her time in Tartarus, then she must remain there. This is the Law of Abode.
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> Not a crumb shall pass her lips. She will be too sad to eat.
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> Hermes, come, my noble messenger.
		<br><b>Hermes -</b> How may I aid you, my king?
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> Go to Hades, and tell him I demand Persephone’s release.
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> Shall I escort you to the underworld? I have the fastest horse in the world, a gift from Poseidon. 
		<br><b>Hermes -</b> Thank you, aunt Demeter, but I believe my winged shoes are faster than any steed. [Leaves to deliver message]
		<br>
		<br>(Scene changes to the Underworld. Hades is trying to persuade Persephone to stay and marry him.)
		<br><b>Hades -</b> Persephone! Look what I made you! The most delicious meals of all time! Persephone. (Hands her “food”)
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> (Crosses arms, looks away, but smiles) No way am I ever eating that.
		<br><b>Hades -</b> [frustrated] Why must you be so hard to please.
		<br>
		<br>(Hades gives Persephone the seeds)
		<br><b>Hades -</b> Here are some seeds. These will grow into special plants, plants that do not need sunlight to grow. Plant them in that garden over there Have this little boy to help you as well, to help you. (Walks away back to the underworld)
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> *Scoffs* Fine. Come, little boy. [plants the seeds]
		<br><b>Boy -</b> [covers the hole with dirt] Here, I have this pomegranate for you.
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> I’m so hungry… alright fine. Just promise me you won’t tell anyone.
		<br><b>Boy -</b> I promise.
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> [Persephone eats pomegranate]
		<br>
		<br><b>Hermes -</b> [call indicating that he has an important message]
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> Oh! Hermes must be about to deliver a very important message… Maybe he has come to free me! Come along, I don’t want to miss this.
		<br>
		<br>[Persephone and Hermes walk to palace]
		<br><b>Hermes -</b> I have brought you a message from your mother. She wants you home and there was an agreement for an early departure. Anyways, let us be on our way.
		<br>(When leaving, Persephone sees the little boy rushing to Hades with the pomegranate in his hand)
		<br>
		<br><b>Boy -</b> Lord Hades! I saw Persephone eat a little bit of a pomegranate! 6 seeds to be exact!
		<br><b>Hades -</b> Oh, really… that means she must stay with me! HA HA HA! I must tell Zeus now! Persephone will be mine!!! [runs over to Zeus] Zeus, my lord, 	Persephone has eaten six pomegranate seeds, and so she must stay with me. It is the Law of Abode!
		<br><b>Demeter - WHAT!?</b> But the boy tricked her. She can not be held accountable!!!
		<br><b>Zeus -</b> Hmmm... After hearing both arguments, I have reached a conclusion. Because Persephone ate pomegranate seeds, she will stay with Hades in the underworld for six months, and come to the surface with Demeter for the other six months. 
		<br><b>Persephone -</b> Please don’t worry mother. I will be fine. You don’t need to suffer. I feel like Hades will take good care of me! 
		<br><b>Demeter -</b> I WILL SUFFER!!! The people will have to learn to deal with a growing season and a season where nothing will grow! Plants will cease to grow while you are in that wretched place!
