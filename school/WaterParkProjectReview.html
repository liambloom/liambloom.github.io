		Personal Reflection:<br>
	</h1>
	<p>
		What are your thoughts/feelings in regard to the work that you produced during this project? <br>
		I think that most of the work was quite nice. although some of it was kind of rushed. Although I think some of the work was rushed and/or stressful, finished project was pretty good.
	</p>
	<p>
		What might you change or include if you were to do this again?  <br>
		If I were to do this again, I would planned the work out better with the group, such as how and when we would do it. Task 5 in particular was disorganized, different people rounded in different parts of the work, sometimes people didn't round at all, and we were not all on the same problem at once
	</p>
	<p>
		How could the information you learned, the tasks you did, or the skills you developed help you or your community in the future?
		The information we learned in this project could help us because these are skills that people sometimes have to use for their jobs, such as mapmakers or . It could also help our community because it could allow you to plan things such as where to put new buildings in your community.
