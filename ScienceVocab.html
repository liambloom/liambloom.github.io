			Cell Vocab
		</h1>
	<br>
		<h2>
			All Cells
		</h2>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Cell Membrane
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>cell membrane</b> is the membrane surrounding the cytoplasm of a cell that controls what comes in and out, similar to the way the firewall in a computer monitors what goes in and out.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Nucleus
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>nucleus</b> is a dense organelle present in most eukaryotic cells, typically a single rounded structure bounded by a double membrane, that controls the cell, similar to how the CPU controls the computer.
		</p>
	<br>	
		<h3>
			Cytoplasm
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>cytoplasm</b> is the jelly like substance, consisting of mostly water, that holds all the other organelles in place, similar to how the circuit board in a computer holds the all the parts in place.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Mitochondrion
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>mitochondria</b> is the part of a cell that produces energy, similar to how the plug supplies power to a computer.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Chromosomes
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>chromosomes</b> are the threadlike structure of nucleic acids and protein found in the nucleolus of most living cells, carrying genetic information in the form of genes such as DNA or RNA, which are the cells instructions on how to do things. This is similar to how the operating system of a computer tells it how to run properly.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Golgi Apparatus
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>golgi apparatus</b> is a complex of vesicles and folded membranes within most eukaryotic cells, involved in intracellular transport, similar to how the monitor of a computer transports information from the computer to you.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Lysosome
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>lysosomes</b> are an organelle, found especially in animal cells, containing degradative enzymes that help recycle parts or the cell, similar to how when you delete data on a hard drive the space is recycled.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Ribosome
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>ribosomes</b> are minute particles consisting of RNA and associated proteins, found in large numbers in living cells, that synthesize proteins, similar to how the pixels on this screen are being synthesized into words by your eyes.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Vacuole
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>vacuole</b> is a space or vesicle within the cytoplasm of a cell, enclosed by a membrane and typically containing fluid, similar to how the hard drive of a computer contains the memory.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Endoplasmic Reticulum
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>endoplasmic reticulum</b> <i>(E.R. for short)</i> is a network of passageways within a eukaryotic cell, usually covered in ribosomes, and is similar to the wires in a computer because they both act as passageways.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Nucleolus
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>nucleolus</b> is a small dense spherical structure in the nucleus of a cell that synthesizes ribosomes, similar to how 0s and 1s are being synthesized to text made out of pixels.
		</p> 
	<br>
		<h2>
			Plant Cells
		</h2>
		<p>
			A <b>plant cell</b> is the type of eukaryotic cell that is found in the organisms within the Plant Kingdom, similar to a Mac, which is a type of computer named after a plant.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Cell Wall
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>cell wall</b> is a rigid layer of polysaccharides lying outside the plasma membrane of the cells of plants, fungi, and bacteria, which is similar to the computer chasis because they are both sturdy outsides of the things they're part of.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Chloroplasts
		</h3>
		<p>
			A <b>chloroplast</b> is a plastid that contains chlorophyll (which is what makes the cell green) and in which photosynthesis takes place, and helps give plant cells enegy, similar to how a plug gives a computer energy.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h2>
			Animal Cells
		</h2>
		<p>
			An <b>animal cell</b> is the type of eukaryotic cell that is found in the organisms within the Animal Kingdom, similar to a Dell computer, which is a type of windows computer.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Cilia
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>cilia</b> are short, microscopic, hairlike structures that occur in large numbers on the surface of <u>certain cells</u>, either causing currents in the surrounding fluid, or, in some protozoans and other small organisms, providing propulsion. This is similar to the hinges on a laptop, which are what makes it easily portable.
		</p>
	<br>
		<h3>
			Centrioles
		</h3>
		<p>
			The <b>centriole</b> is a minute cylindrical organelle near the nucleus in animal cells, occurring in pairs and involved in the development of spindle fibers in cell division, wich makes a new cell, similar to how copy and paste on computers duplicates things.
