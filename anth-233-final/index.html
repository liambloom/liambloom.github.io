                <p>
                    In my first year seminar, when I first encountered Queer in an academic setting, 
                    and not just as an identity category, my eyes were opened to the true breadth
                    of identity (or so I thought) as I discovered that it was even more socially
                    constructed than I previously thought. It also, by opening my eyes, either turned me
                    into or made me realize I was a queer subject myself. Then, I took global queer
                    studies and my horizons exploded once again, as the framework that I thought
                    was broad enough to fit every imaginable identity was broken and rebuilt before
                    my eyes. Now, I present the tiniest sliver of the thing we call "queer" in a form
                    that I hope presents some meaningful piece of what queer might be.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This piece uses code (specifically HTML, CSS, and javascript) to depict various
                    terms associated with "queer" moving and shifting and to display possible meanings
                    for the terms. Due to time constraints, there are only ten terms included in the piece
                    (each term can take well over an hour to find appropriate "meanings"). Seven of them
                    are on screen at any given moment, which allows the displayed words to vary, and 
                    lets it appear busy with terms, but not so crowded that it becomes unreadable.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The words are displayed in the Modak font. This font was chosen because of its 
                    bubby appearance and small gaps, which give a playful, light appearance (to 
                    symbolize the freeness of "queer") and helps make the words readable while in motion.
                    They flow on and off the screen because no term or idea in queer studies is permanent
                    or always accessible; every concept and comes in and out of clarity and legibility.
                    They also gradually fade at the edges because nothing in queer studies has a fixed
                    border, whether it is definitions, societies, or this piece. I will note that the
                    reason the terms have a black border when displayed is despite, and not because, 
                    of symbolic reasons. Without the black border, the terms are nearly illegible, and
                    while legibility is of debatable importance to the use of the terms, it is necessary
                    for the message of this piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eight of the ten terms are what I would call "queer" terms; these include concepts
                    like "queer" and "gender" as well as specific identities like "<i>hijra</i>" and 
                    <i>tongzhi</i>. As they move across the page, their borders also shift, growing
                    and shrinking with their movement and with time, symbolizing how these terms
                    change. Each time a queer term enters the page it is also assigned a random color 
                    in the HSL color space with 100% saturation, 50% lightness, and a hue between 0 
                    (red) and 270 (violet). These vibrant rainbow colors are inspired by the rainbow
                    pride flag, a symbol of the diversity and variety of the people it represents. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'd like to take a moment to highlight one queer term in particular: "Fields"&mdash;as in
                    Jacquelyn Fields, the primary subject of Lyndon K. Gill's 2012 paper "Situating Black, 
                    Situating Queer: Black Queer Diaspora Studies and The Art of Embodied Listening."
                    While many of the ideas represented in this work can be described by unique words, 
                    many of the complex intersectional identities that are the subject of queer studies
                    have no such terms. In these cases, while it is possible to combine terms to create
                    something that approximates an idea, a far more thorough and nuanced concept can be 
                    represented by reference to a subject rather than a concept. This is why Gill's paper,
                    ostensibly about the abstract concept of Black queer diaspora subjectivity, spends so 
                    much time on a single Black queer diasporic subject. Similarly, I use Fields to represent
                    a multifaceted queer construct that could not otherwise be labeled, and thus could not
                    otherwise be included in a label-based study of queerness such as this piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Each queer term is associated with a list of "meanings." This list is shuffled when
                    the page first loads and then displayed in order; this ensures that if you keep clicking
                    on the same term, you will get many different meanings. The purpose of the meanings
                    is self-explanatory, all of these terms have multiple meanings because queer is 
                    subversive, so any queer term will inherently subvert any attempt to define it. These
                    definitions (as well as this artist's statement) are in the for Courier Prime, a 
                    classic-looking monospaced font similar to the fonts used by programmers, to symbolize
                    the medium of this piece.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In addition to the eight queer terms, there are two terms that I did not dub queer 
                    terms: homonationalism and pinkwashing. While queer terms attempt to describe 
                    the lived experiences of queer subjects in subversive and varied ways, these terms
                    describe actions by centers of power (especially the state) to take advantage of 
                    queer subjects and identities for their own purposes. They each have only one possible
                    meaning that shows up when they are clicked. This is not because these terms only have 
                    one possible meaning&mdash;they are, after all, still a part of queer 
                    studies&mdash;rather, I have only included one possible meaning in order to symbolize
                    the non-queerness and non-subversiveness of the actions described by these terms. For
                    the same reason, the borders of these terms stay fixed, rather than growing and
                    shrinking like the borders of the queer terms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The colors of these terms also fall outside the rainbow that is used for the 
                    queer terms. Pinkwashing is written in pink for obvious reasons, and homonationalism
                    is written in either old glory red, white, or old glory blue, the official colors of 
                    the US flag, to represent the state that is enacting it. None of these terms have 
                    the same saturation or lightness as the rainbow colors used for queer terms. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally, the most important piece of symbolism in this piece is the randomness.
                    Random numbers are generated in 14 different places in the code, determining the 
                    movement of the terms (<input type="checkbox" id="showMovePaths"> click this checkbox 
                    to show the random points that control the path the words take), the shifting of
                    their borders, what color they are, the placement of their meanings, and which 
                    meanings are used. This ensures that just like how every experience and understanding
                    of queerness is unique, so too, is every experience of this piece.

particular Black queer diasporic subject to specify
an earlier obliquely referenced Black queer subjectivity. (Gill 32)-->

<!--
 It has been humbling and also very interesting to see the ways homonationalism as
 a concept has been deployed, adapted, rearticulated, and critiqued in various national,
 activist, and academic contexts; giving rise to generative and constructive debate was
 my true intent in writing the book, which was derived not as a corrective but as an
 incitement to debate. (Puar 336)-->
