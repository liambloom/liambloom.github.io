	<p style="color:#1155cc;"><b>Natsha:</b> Em hotep nefer. How terrible that our governor, _________, has passed. Now, we must mummify him/her to prepare him/her for the afterlife.</p>
	<p style="color:#9b3cba;"><b>Michelle:</b> After a person has passed, they are sent through to the afterlife. A life beyond death, where you are resurrected.</p>
	<p style="color:#38761d;"><b>Liam:</b> Mummifying a body slows down the process of decomposition. In the afterlife, you use the body you had when you were alive.</p>
	<p style="color:#9b3cba;"><b>Michelle:</b> Additionally, we will bury _______’s items along with him/her, so that she/he can use them in the afterlife.</p>
	<p style="color:#1155cc;"><b>Natsha:</b> If you want to stay and watch, you can.</p>
	<p style="color:#8f8f8f;"><b>Visitor:</b> Though a governor like me has places to be, I guess I can spare time to watch. I’ve never seen a mummification before... (sits down on floor)</p>
	<p style="color:#38761d;"><b>Liam:</b> First, we will take out the organs, except for the heart.</p>
	<p style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Tina:</b> Osiris will use the heart to judge _______ on the way to the afterlife.</p>
	<p style="color:#1155cc;"><b>Natsha:</b> The heart will be weighed against the feather of truth. If the heart is too heavy, then ________ will not be allowed into the afterlife.</p>
	<p style="color:#38761d;"><b>Liam:</b> (cuts open the body with a knife)</p>
	<p style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Tina:</b> (takes out the organs)</p>
	<p style="color:#9b3cba;"><b>Michelle:</b> (takes the brain in her hand and stares at it) What’s this weird spongy thing anyways? Seems pretty useless to me. (throws the brain over her shoulder)</p>
	<p style="color:#1155cc;"><b>Natsha:</b> Now we put the organs in jars. We put the organs in the jars because they are needed in the afterlife.</p>
	<p style="color:#000000;">(Each person put one organ into a jar)</p>
	<p style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Tina:</b> We will now pour palm wine and natron to remove the moisture inside this body. Natron will also be poured into the jars for the same reason.</p>
	<p style="color:#1155cc;"><b>Natsha:</b> (place natron packets into body)</p>
	<p style="color:#38761d;"><b>Liam:</b> (pours palm wine into body)</p>
	<p style="color:#9b3cba;"><b>Michelle:</b> (pours natron onto body)</p>
	<p style="color:#ff0000;"><b>Tina:</b> (pours natron into the jars)</p>
